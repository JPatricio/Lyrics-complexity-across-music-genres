## Measuring lyrical complexity across music genres

The aim of this project is to use a number of metrics for measuring textual complexity so as to verify if and how it might vary in different music genres.

### Summary
* __Dataset and Methodology__

The used dataset comprised lyrics fetched from the [Musixmatch API](http://developer.musixmatch.com). A total of 12 genres (Blues, Classical, Country, Eletronic, Jazz, Latin, Pop, R&B/Soul, Hip-Hop/Rap, Alternative, Rock and Reggae) were considered in this experiment. The 2000 most popular song lyrics (according to Musicmatchâ€™s metrics) for each of them was used.

Two distinct approaches are used to measure textual complexity. A first is bound to simple statistical measures. The second, relates to textual cohesion and syntactic diversity.
